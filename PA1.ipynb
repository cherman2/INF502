    "I followed the steps you orginally laid out. I created The functions: matchscore, contiguouschainscore and a function I called shifter(which will later be split into topshifter and bottomshifter. I'll explain more when I get to that hiccup). I got all these functions working and I procceded on to the userinput function and the fileopener function. I then implements a function called is best. This allows me to figure out the best match score or the best contig score. "
